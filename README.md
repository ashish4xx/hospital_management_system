File Name: Hotem Management System.
Description: 
This C++ program represents a simplified hospital management system with multiple departments where patients can be added, managed, and listed. The program allows the user to perform various operations based on the chosen department, such as adding normal or critically ill patients, taking patients to a doctor, and displaying the list of patients.

The program begins by defining a structure `patient` that holds information about patients, such as their first name, last name, age, blood group, gender, mobile number, and a pointer to the next patient. The program also includes a class `linkedqueue` that represents a linked list-based queue of patients. Each department is represented by an instance of the `linkedqueue` class.

The main parts of the program are as follows:

1. **Input and Patient Creation (`input` function):**
The `input` function allows the user to input patient data. It validates the blood group input using a loop and conditional statements to ensure that only valid blood groups are accepted. If a blood group is invalid, the program informs the user and prompts them to enter the blood group again. After validating the blood group, the function collects other patient information.

2. **Adding Patients (`insertatbeg`, `insertatend` functions):**
The `insertatbeg` and `insertatend` functions add a patient to the beginning or end of the linked queue, respectively. The patient information is collected using the `input` function. If the patient ID is found to be invalid (already exists), the operation is canceled.

3. **Taking Patient to Doctor (`getpatientout` function):**
The `getpatientout` function simulates taking a patient to a doctor. It removes the patient from the front of the queue and displays the patient's information.

4. **Listing Patients (`listofpatients` function):**
The `listofpatients` function lists all patients in the department's queue by iterating through the linked list and displaying patient details.

5. **Department Menu (`departmentmenu` function):**
The `departmentmenu` function represents a submenu for a specific department. It allows the user to choose various operations such as adding patients, taking patients to a doctor, and displaying the list of patients. The submenu operates in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

6. **Main Function (`main` function):**
The `main` function represents the program's entry point. It initializes four department instances and provides a main menu where the user can choose a department or exit the program. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding department menu is displayed using the `departmentmenu` function.

The program provides a text-based interface and utilizes loops, conditional statements, linked lists, and user input to manage patient data in different hospital departments. While the program's functionality is quite basic, it demonstrates a simple example of managing data using classes, structures, and control structures in C++.
